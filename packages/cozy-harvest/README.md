Harvest
=====

Cozy-Harvest will bring the logic, modules and components used in harvest applications.

Harvest applications will be apps which will allow to configure konnectors, setup authentification informations and check for synchronized data (And much more in the future).
Each harvest application will be associated with only one konnector.

This first version is just an "Hello world" version aimed at initializing the lib and make it available in NPM

### Usage

```js
import Harvest from 'cozy-harvest'
```
